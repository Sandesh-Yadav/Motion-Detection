# Motion-Detection
A motion detector program using computer vision in python without using any haar cascade file. This program detects a motion and records the time from which the motion starts and the time when the motion ends in a CSV file. (The file is created automatically by the program).
This program has a drawback that it cannot detect motion in less light/brightness or dark background.
